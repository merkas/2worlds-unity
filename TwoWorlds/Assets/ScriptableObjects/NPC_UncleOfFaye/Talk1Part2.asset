  npcText:
  - Yes, it's that luminescent flower honey that everyone is going on about. I myself
    set out a long time ago to collect this special kind of honey. I didn't manage
    to fill up a whole jar, but I did get to taste a fingertip. So a glass of it
    is really hard to come by. Your friend is very lucky to have you!
  playerResponse:
  - answer: That's so sweet of you. I really hope he enjoys my gift! Next time I'll
      bring you a glass too, if there is the chance of getting some again!
